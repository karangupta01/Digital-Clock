# Digital Clock Project

This project is a real-time digital clock built with JavaScript, showcasing essential concepts and dynamic web development techniques.
The clock continuously updates to display the current hours, minutes, and seconds, providing an accurate timekeeping feature.

## How It Works
- The digital clock fetches the current time using JavaScript’s `Date` object.
- It updates the displayed time every second with the `setInterval()` method.
- Time elements are manipulated and displayed using **DOM (Document Object Model)** methods.

## JavaScript Concepts Used
- **Date Object:** Fetches the current time with `new Date()`.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Updates HTML elements using `getElementById()` and `textContent`.
- **setInterval():** Ensures the clock updates every second.
- **String Methods:** Formats time values with leading zeros for consistency.

This project is a great demonstration of JavaScript’s ability to create real-time, interactive web applications while enhancing DOM manipulation skills.
